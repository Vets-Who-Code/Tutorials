# ðŸ‘‹Welcome

This folder stores all of the markdown files linked to in the resources.md file.

Before you add a link to one of these markdown files, make sure the team approves. 

The criteria is easy: Is this the best quality learning or reference resource available on the web? If so, add it.

Our goal here is quality, not quantity.

## Style Guide
All links will be h2 size and will describe the tutorial or resource as concisely as possible.
