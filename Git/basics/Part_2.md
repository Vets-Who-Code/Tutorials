## Introduction

In Vets Who Code we have a pretty solid [curriculum](https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/Curriculum) where we teach from the basics to the more advanced. Week 1 of training involves the command line, VS Code, Markdown, and Git. This tutorial is on the basics of Git. Last time I explained to you about creating a repo, clone a repo, creating a new branch, adding, committing, pushing changes, and making a pull request. You can read about that here:

This article I am going to explain forking a repo, making changes, and doing a pull request. The reward for completing this tutorial is a free Vets Who Code sticker ðŸ™Œ

## Requirements

1. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 8 or later installed locally.
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another code editor.
3. npm â€” npm is distributed with Node.js - which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
4. A [Github](www.github.com) account.

## Fork a Repo

A fork :fork: is a copy of a repository. Forking a repo allows someone to freely make changes to their own copy of a program without affecting the old repo. You can pretty much fork any open source project on Github. There are several reasons to fork a repo:

- You are working on a program and you come across a bug in it. If the repo is available, you can fork it to propose changes related to fixing a bug instead of submitting a bug report.
- You can use someone elses project as a starting point for your own.

## Instructions

To start go to https://github.com/gixxerblade/vwc-sticker-giveaway click **fork**.

![Fork repo](https://i.ibb.co/pKgfM4W/01-fork-repo.png)

Go to your page on Github. It'll be **github.com/your-username** and then go to the repo you just forked.

Click the green labeled **Clone or download** and copy the link that that starts with `git@github:your-username/...`

![Clone or download](https://i.ibb.co/4KYyRHd/02-clone-repo.png)

Open your code editor, open up your terminal and type `git clone <the link from the previous step>`

You'll see Github perform some actions in your terminal:

![Git clone terminal output](https://i.ibb.co/7G3wpfV/03-git-clone-terminal.png)

Next you'll `cd <name of the folder you just cloned into>`. **cd** just means **change directory**

Type `npm install` â€” `npm install` installs all the dependencies a program needs based on the `package.json` file and puts them in the `node_modules` folder in your directory.

Type `git checkout -b mysticker`
`git checkout -b something-here` creates a new branch [as we discussed in the previous tutorial](https://dev.to/vetswhocode/git-22li#create-a-new-branch).

Type `npm run address` and follow the prompts. Please make sure to enter your address carefully (so I know where to send the sticker to!)

Copy the encrypted address to a new file in `/stickers/<your-github-username>.txt`

Type `git add . && git commit -m <your-message>`

Type `git push origin mysticker`

When you're done, your terminal should look similar to this:

![npm run address results](https://i.ibb.co/87tRj9v/04-instructions.png)

Open new pull request on Github [like we went through in the last lesson](https://dev.to/vetswhocode/git-22li#making-a-pull-request).

Wait a few weeks for your sticker.

## Wrapping it up

You just learned how to fork a repo. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. If you did please give me a :heart:. I like doing these tutorials beacuse they reinforce stuff that I have learned (and continue to learn).
